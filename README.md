# Deap Learning Course Repository

This repository includes the assignments of a deep learning course in which I participated (in university).

The assignments are as follows:

Assignment | Task |Description
--- | --- | ---
Assignment 1 | Build an ANN from "scratch" | In this assignment we built a fully functioning neural network with implementation of forward/backward propagation.
Assignment 2 | One Shot Learning with CNN Siamese Network | In this assignment we built a network to classify whether two pictures of previously unseen people are of the same person. We exprimenterd different distance functions and ImageNet as a base model.
Assignment 3 | Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) | In this assignment we firstly trined a GAN to generate samplesof diabetes patiants. Secondly, we trained a GAN with a "twist". We have a Black Box Model (BB Model) that is already trained, and our goal is to generate data that is similar to the data that used to train the BB Model. We do that by the discriminator receiving an output from the generator and an output from the BB Model, and it should classify which sample is the real one.
